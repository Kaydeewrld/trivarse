# Trivarse Website

This repository contains the static files for **Trivarse**, a marketing agency that offers transformative marketing solutions for businesses. The site is entirely static and can be served without any additional build steps.

## Local Development

There is no build process required. Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the directory with a static web server. For example:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 5504
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5504` in your browser. (The repository includes a VS Code `settings.json` that configures Live Server to use port `5504`.)

## Build Tools

All assets and scripts under `css/`, `js/`, `fonts/`, and `images/` are already built. There are no source files or build commands in the repository.
